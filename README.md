# Arduino Wireless Access System
This project features a wireless (RFID based) room access system, based on Arduino Uno.

Because most of it was done on very short notice, the code is bug-ridden and generally poorly written.
Someday I might come back here and rewrite it so it becomes usable and optimal. Until this day
the code shall serve as a reminder of how poor developer I am.
