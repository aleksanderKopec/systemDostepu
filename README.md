# Arduino Wireless Access System
This project features a wireless (RFID based) room access system, based on Arduino Uno.

I included some comments, but the code itself is very poorly written and 
not optimal as it was written on very short notice and I had to experiment a lot
with parts of the system. Someday I may rewrite it and make it usable in different scenarios.
